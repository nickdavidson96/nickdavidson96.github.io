## Project description

This program uses Racket to organize a file and output the correct file.
## How to run the program

How to run the program.

To run this project, you can install Dr. Racket, and run from the Application interface.

Another way to run this program is through an IDE such as Visual Studio Code , given that you install Racket Repl.

## UI Design

The way to run the program below (see Fig 1) When the Program is run, it should generate similar results (see Fig 2). If you do not have the proper file location, an error will occur (see Fig 3).

## 3. Additional Considerations

You should ensure your computer or IDE has an interpreter installed/available to be able to run the program, as well as the proper file location.
